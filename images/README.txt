This directory should contain the following images:

1. hero-device.png - Image of a person wearing the Eulogy pendant device
2. device.png - Close-up image of the Eulogy pendant device
3. feature-icon.png - Icon for feature sections

To generate placeholder SVG images:
1. Open the placeholder-generator.html file in a web browser
